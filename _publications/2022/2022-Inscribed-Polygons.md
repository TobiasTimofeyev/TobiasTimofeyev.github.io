  Tverberg's theorem states that any set of t(r,d)=(r-1)(d+1)+1 points in \mathbb{R}^d can be partitioned into r subsets whose convex hulls have non-empty r-fold intersection. Moreover, generic collections of fewer points cannot be so divided. Extending earlier work of the first author, we show that one can nonetheless guarantee inscribed ``polytopal partitions" with specified symmetry conditions in many such circumstances. Namely, for any faithful and full--dimensional orthogonal representation \rho\colon G\rightarrow O(d) of any order r group G, we show that a generic set of t(r,d)-d points in \mathbb{R}^d can be partitioned into r subsets so that there are r points, one from each of the resulting convex hulls, which are the vertices of a convex d--polytope whose isometry group contains G via the regular action afforded by the representation. As with Tverberg's theorem, the number of points is optimal for this. At one extreme, this gives polytopal partitions for all regular r--gons in the plane, as well as for three of the six regular 4--polytopes in \mathbb{R}^4. At the other extreme, one has polytopal partitions for d-polytopes on r vertices with isometry group equal to G whenever G is the isometry group of a vertex--transitive d-polytope.
